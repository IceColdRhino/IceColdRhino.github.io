I recently reached a "critical mass" of disorganization in all my personal scripts I have laying around, so I decided to finally bring some version control and code organization in to my personal life instead of only using it in a professional setting. Hopefully this more public hosting of my work may also force me to write stuff that's more tidy and legible as well, but only time will tell on that front.

As long as I'm putting stuff on GitHub I decided to host it in blog format too. This is in no small part inspired by [this blog](https://haraldkliems.netlify.app), whose author I have [collaborated with in the past](https://haraldkliems.netlify.app/posts/pedestrian-fatalities-soar-just-after-sunset). However, while Harald's site is more focused on public outreach, this one is (at least initially) more a means to remind myself what the hell my thought process was, when I inevitably set some project down and don't happen to pick it up again until a few months have passed.

Self-effacing introduction aside though, as long as you're here go ahead and feel free to look around!
